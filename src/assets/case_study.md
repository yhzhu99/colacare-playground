### Feature Importance Weights

- **DoctorAgent1**: The mortality prediction risk for the patient from AdaCare model is 0.03 out of 1.0, which means the patient is at a low level of death risk. Our model especially pays great attention to following features:
  - Carbon dioxide binding power: with shap value of 0.157. The feature value is 23.4 mmol/L, which is 15.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (27.39 mmol/L), 15.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (27.42 mmol/L). The reference range is 20 mmol/L to 29 mmol/L.
  - Blood sodium: with shap value of 0.044. The feature value is 130.5 mmol/L, which is 6.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (138.66 mmol/L), 5.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (137.27 mmol/L). The reference range is 135 mmol/L to 145 mmol/L.
  - Hemoglobin: with shap value of 0.022. The feature value is 109.0 g/L, which is 5.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (114.98 g/L), 3.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (112.14 g/L). The reference range is 115 g/L to 150 g/L.

- **DoctorAgent2**: The mortality prediction risk for the patient from ConCare model is 0.84 out of 1.0, which means the patient is at an extremely high level of death risk. Our model especially pays great attention to following features:
  - Albumin: with importance weight of 0.543 out of 1.0. The feature value is 34.8 g/L, which is 8.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (38.02 g/L), 2.0% higher than the average value of deceased patients (34.04 g/L). The reference range is 40 g/L to 55 g/L.
  - Hemoglobin: with importance weight of 0.277 out of 1.0. The feature value is 109.0 g/L, which is 5.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (114.98 g/L), 3.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (112.14 g/L). The reference range is 115 g/L to 150 g/L.
  - Blood phosphorus: with importance weight of 0.127 out of 1.0. The feature value is 1.67 mmol/L, which is 4.0% higher than the average value of survival patients (1.6 mmol/L), 8.0% higher than the average value of deceased patients (1.55 mmol/L). The reference range is 1.1 mmol/L to 1.3 mmol/L.
  - Blood sodium: with importance weight of 0.053 out of 1.0. The feature value is 130.5 mmol/L, which is 6.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (138.66 mmol/L), 5.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (137.27 mmol/L). The reference range is 135 mmol/L to 145 mmol/L.

- **DoctorAgent3**: The mortality prediction risk for the patient from RETAIN model is 0.46 out of 1.0, which means the patient is at a low level of death risk. Our model especially pays great attention to following features:
  - Carbon dioxide binding power: with shap value of 0.021. The feature value is 23.4 mmol/L, which is 15.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (27.39 mmol/L), 15.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (27.42 mmol/L). The reference range is 20 mmol/L to 29 mmol/L.

{
    "Logit": "0.03",
    "Analysis": "The patient, a 66-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease due to Diabetic Nephropathy, exhibits a low mortality risk as per the AdaCare model. Key indicators such as carbon dioxide binding power, blood sodium, and hemoglobin are slightly below average but within the reference ranges, suggesting manageable metabolic and hematological parameters. The patient's condition is stable, with no acute exacerbations noted in the provided data.",
    "Evidences": [
        "Carbon dioxide binding power at 23.4 mmol/L is within the reference range of 20 mmol/L to 29 mmol/L, indicating normal acid-base balance.",
        "Blood sodium at 130.5 mmol/L is slightly below the normal range of 135 mmol/L to 145 mmol/L, but not indicative of severe electrolyte imbalance.",
        "Hemoglobin at 109.0 g/L is within the normal range of 115 g/L to 150 g/L, suggesting adequate oxygen-carrying capacity."

{
    "Logit": "0.84",
    "Analysis": "The patient's condition is critical, with a high mortality risk indicated by the AI model. Key factors contributing to this risk include low albumin levels, which are below the reference range and indicative of malnutrition or liver dysfunction, and low hemoglobin levels, suggesting anemia. Elevated blood phosphorus levels and slightly low blood sodium levels also contribute to the overall poor prognosis. These findings are consistent with the patient's underlying conditions of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, heart failure, and lung infection.",
    "Evidences": [
        "Document [1] (Title: Diabetic Nephropathy - Genitourinary Disorders - MSD Manual Professional Edition) discusses the progressive deterioration of renal function in diabetic nephropathy, which can lead to malnutrition and anemia.",
        "Document [5] (Title: Anemia of Renal Disease - Hematology and Oncology - MSD Manual Professional Edition) explains that anemia is a common complication of renal failure, which is directly related to the patient's low hemoglobin levels.",
        "Document [8] (Title: Hyperphosphatemia - Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders - MSD Manual Professional Edition) highlights that hyperphosphatemia is a common issue in patients with advanced renal insufficiency, as seen in the patient's elevated blood phosphorus levels.",
        "Document [12] (Title: Hypermagnesemia - Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders - MSD Manual Professional Edition) mentions that electrolyte imbalances, such as low sodium levels, can occur in patients with renal failure, which is relevant to the patient's condition."

    "Analysis": "The patient, aged 66.56, is an End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patient with a history of Diabetic Nephropathy, Diabetes, Heart failure, Lung infection, and Cerebral infarction. The patient's condition is complex and severe, as indicated by the high levels of creatinine (ranging from 410 to 832 \u03bcmol/L), which are significantly above the normal range (62-106 \u03bcmol/L for males). This indicates severe renal dysfunction. Additionally, the patient has fluctuating blood glucose levels, which are particularly high at times (up to 28.0 mmol/L), suggesting poor diabetes control. The patient's blood potassium levels are also concerning, with values as high as 9.84 mmol/L, which is significantly above the normal range (3.5-5.0 mmol/L) and poses a risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's blood phosphorus levels are also elevated, which can contribute to further renal damage and cardiovascular complications. The patient's hemoglobin levels are low (ranging from 52 to 130 g/L), indicating anemia, which is common in chronic kidney disease and can exacerbate fatigue and other symptoms. The patient's systolic blood pressure is also variable, with some readings indicating hypertension, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Overall, the patient's condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunctions and a high risk of complications.",

### Final Report

The patient, aged 66.56, is an End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patient with a history of Diabetic Nephropathy, Diabetes, Heart failure, Lung infection, and Cerebral infarction. Key concerns include severe renal dysfunction indicated by high creatinine levels (410-832 \u03bcmol/L), poor diabetes control with high blood glucose levels (up to 28.0 mmol/L), and significant electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia (blood potassium up to 9.84 mmol/L) and hyperphosphatemia.
