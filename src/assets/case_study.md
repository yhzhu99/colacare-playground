### Feature Importance Weights

- **DoctorAgent1**: The mortality prediction risk for the patient from AdaCare model is 0.03 out of 1.0, which means the patient is at a low level of death risk. Our model especially pays great attention to following features:
  - Carbon dioxide binding power: with shap value of 0.157. The feature value is 23.4 mmol/L, which is 15.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (27.39 mmol/L), 15.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (27.42 mmol/L). The reference range is 20 mmol/L to 29 mmol/L.
  - Blood sodium: with shap value of 0.044. The feature value is 130.5 mmol/L, which is 6.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (138.66 mmol/L), 5.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (137.27 mmol/L). The reference range is 135 mmol/L to 145 mmol/L.
  - Hemoglobin: with shap value of 0.022. The feature value is 109.0 g/L, which is 5.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (114.98 g/L), 3.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (112.14 g/L). The reference range is 115 g/L to 150 g/L.

- **DoctorAgent2**: The mortality prediction risk for the patient from ConCare model is 0.84 out of 1.0, which means the patient is at an extremely high level of death risk. Our model especially pays great attention to following features:
  - Albumin: with importance weight of 0.543 out of 1.0. The feature value is 34.8 g/L, which is 8.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (38.02 g/L), 2.0% higher than the average value of deceased patients (34.04 g/L). The reference range is 40 g/L to 55 g/L.
  - Hemoglobin: with importance weight of 0.277 out of 1.0. The feature value is 109.0 g/L, which is 5.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (114.98 g/L), 3.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (112.14 g/L). The reference range is 115 g/L to 150 g/L.
  - Blood phosphorus: with importance weight of 0.127 out of 1.0. The feature value is 1.67 mmol/L, which is 4.0% higher than the average value of survival patients (1.6 mmol/L), 8.0% higher than the average value of deceased patients (1.55 mmol/L). The reference range is 1.1 mmol/L to 1.3 mmol/L.
  - Blood sodium: with importance weight of 0.053 out of 1.0. The feature value is 130.5 mmol/L, which is 6.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (138.66 mmol/L), 5.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (137.27 mmol/L). The reference range is 135 mmol/L to 145 mmol/L.

- **DoctorAgent3**: The mortality prediction risk for the patient from RETAIN model is 0.46 out of 1.0, which means the patient is at a low level of death risk. Our model especially pays great attention to following features:
  - Carbon dioxide binding power: with shap value of 0.021. The feature value is 23.4 mmol/L, which is 15.0% lower than the average value of survival patients (27.39 mmol/L), 15.0% lower than the average value of deceased patients (27.42 mmol/L). The reference range is 20 mmol/L to 29 mmol/L.

    "Answer": "disagree",
    "Confidence": 0.7,
    "Reason": "The patient's condition, while serious, does not necessarily indicate a high mortality risk based on the provided data and the low mortality risk prediction by the AdaCare model.",
    "Evidences": [
        "Document [0]: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. Symptoms develop slowly and in advanced stages include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, dysgeusia, nocturia, lassitude, fatigue, pruritus, decreased mental acuity, muscle twitches and cramps, water retention, undernutrition, peripheral neuropathies, and seizures. Diagnosis is based on laboratory testing of renal function, sometimes followed by renal biopsy. Treatment is primarily directed at the underlying condition but includes fluid and electrolyte management, blood pressure control, treatment of anemia, various types of dialysis, and kidney transplantation.",
        "Document [7]: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is suspected when urine output falls or serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine rise. Per the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury (1), AKI is defined as any of the following: Increase in the serum creatinine value of \u2265 0.3 mg/dL (26.52 micromol/L) in 48 hours Increase in serum creatinine of \u2265 1.5 times baseline within the prior 7 days Urine volume  0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours Evaluation should determine the presence and type of AKI and seek a cause."

- **DoctorAgent2**:

```json
{
    "Answer": "agree",
    "Confidence": 0.9,
    "Reason": "The patient's low albumin levels and low urea levels, along with anemia, are consistent with severe malnutrition, liver dysfunction, and renal impairment, which are significant risk factors for mortality in ESRD patients. These findings align with the leader expert's assessment of a high mortality risk."
}
```

- **DoctorAgent3**:

```json
{
    "Answer": "agree",
    "Confidence": 0.9,
    "Reason": "The leader expert's summary report highlights critical health indicators such as low albumin levels, low urea levels, and low hemoglobin levels, which are consistent with severe malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and anemia. These factors are well-documented in medical literature as significant contributors to high mortality risk in patients with ESRD."
}
```

- **MetaAgent**:

```json
{
    "Action": "Continue the discussion",
    "Reason": "Doctor 0 strongly disagrees with the previous summary report and provides high confidence along with relevant literature to support their viewpoint, indicating a need for further discussion."
}
```

```json
{
    "Answer": "In my opinion, the patient has a high risk of mortality.",
    "Report": "68-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) due to benign arteriosclerosis. Key health indicators include significantly low albumin levels, low urea levels, and low hemoglobin levels, indicating severe malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and anemia. These factors, along with the patient's advanced age and ESRD, contribute to a high mortality risk. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these conditions are critical for patient outcomes.",
    "Reasons": [
        "Doctor 1 and Doctor 2 supported the high mortality risk assessment based on the patient's low albumin, low urea, and low hemoglobin levels, consistent with severe malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and anemia. Doctor 0 disagreed, citing the low mortality risk prediction by the AdaCare model, but the majority consensus and clinical evidence support the high risk assessment."

#### Round 2

- **DoctorAgent1**:

```json
{
    "Answer": "agree",
    "Confidence": 0.9,
    "Reason": "The patient's condition, as indicated by low albumin levels, low urea levels, and low hemoglobin levels, is consistent with severe malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and anemia, which are well-known risk factors for increased mortality in patients with ESRD."
}
```

- **DoctorAgent2**:

```json
{
    "Answer": "agree",
    "Confidence": 0.9,
    "Reason": "The patient's low albumin levels, low urea levels, and anemia, along with ESRD due to benign arteriosclerosis, are consistent with severe malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and anemia, which are significant risk factors for mortality in ESRD patients. These findings align with the leader expert's assessment of a high mortality risk."
}
```

- **DoctorAgent3**:

```json
{
    "Answer": "agree",
    "Confidence": 0.9,
    "Reason": "The patient's advanced age, ESRD due to benign arteriosclerosis, significantly low albumin levels, low urea levels, and low hemoglobin levels collectively indicate severe malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and anemia, which are critical factors contributing to a high mortality risk."

### Final Report

68-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) due to benign arteriosclerosis. Key health indicators include significantly low albumin levels, low urea levels, and low hemoglobin levels, indicating severe malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and anemia. These factors, along with the patient's advanced age and ESRD, contribute to a high mortality risk. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these conditions are critical for patient outcomes.
